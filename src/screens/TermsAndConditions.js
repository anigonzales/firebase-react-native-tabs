             an investigation or related proceeding related to you or your whereabouts; (2) the disclosure is necessary in connection with
              any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Secret Chaperone Site; (3) Lear Solutions is required to disclose 
              such information to comply with any applicable law, subpoena, legal process or governmental request.  Lear Solutions also may

            C.  Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services,
             or changes to this privacy policy.

            D.  Except as previously specified herein, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally 
            identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our 
            business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your 
            information when we believe release is appropriate to operate the Secret Chaperone Site, comply with the law, enforce our site 
            policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be
             provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses

            II. Your Access to and Control Over Information

            A.  You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time.  In order to do so, you must contact us via the email address 
            given on our website. 

            B.  In addition, you may also do any of the following at any time by contacting us via the email address given on our website:

            • See what data Lear Solutions has about you, if any. 
            • Change/correct any data Lear Solutions may have about you.
            • Have Lear Solutions delete any data about you, unless the data is specifically needed to continue use of the Secret 
            Chaperone service, unless you are canceling your account. 
            • Express any concern you may have about Lear Solutions’s use of your data.

            III.  Security

            A.  In handling your information, Lear Solutions takes precautions to protect your information.  When you submit sensitive 
            information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

            B.  Wherever we collect sensitive information, the information is transmitted to us in a secure way. 

            C.  While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. 
             Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, customer service) are granted access to 
             personally identifiable information.  The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept
              in a secure environment.
